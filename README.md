# sortingAlgorithmsVisualizer

## General Information
This python application is intended to help people learn about sorting algorithms. It uses a GUI to help users visualize
bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort, and how they are implemented to sort an array. The users are able to use a series
of sliders and text inputs to create an array of a certain max/min size as well as contain a certain number of elements. They 
are then able to select with sortign algorithm they would like to see and then once "play" is clicked an animation shows the 
step by step process of how the array is sorted through the use of the algorithm.
